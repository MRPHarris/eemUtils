\title{Plot PARAFAC model loadings versus per-sample Fmax at the component peak position.}
\usage{
fmax_peakpick_corrplot(
  pfmodel,
  eemlist,
  component = 1,
  denorm = TRUE,
  labels = FALSE,
  label_threshold = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pfmodel}{A PARAFAC model object.}

\item{eemlist}{An eemlist object.}

\item{component}{Integer. Which PARAFAC component to plot?}

\item{denorm}{TRUE/FALSE denormalise the loadings based upon eemlist (not parafac) fmax values?}

\item{labels}{TRUE/FALSE extract numeric values from sample names and use these as labels. values/10 by default to match a lexicographic scheme.}

\item{label_threshold}{Integer. Values lying above this number multiplied by the mean will be given labels via geom_text}
}
\description{
A simple scatter plot of PARAFAC component loadings versus Fmax data. Optional labelling,
     derived through extraction of numeric values in the sample names. Given fmax is just rescaled loadings data,
     this will typically be perfectly correlated. So, the recommended setting for 'type' is 'peakpick', in which case
     extrpf_fmax() will fetch the intensity at the component maxima in each EEM. The resulting data will be a measure of
     sample-to-model homogeneity, reflecting intra-component variance, underfitting, or spectral overlap at the peak coordinates.
